INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
======================

WSim dependencies and platform requirements are minimal.  Building the GUI
requires the Qt framework 4 or higher.

You can choose to install WSim using either the GNU libbfd or the native
library included in WSim.


Linux/Unix
----------
* From the Repository: 
  ./bootstrap
  ./configure --prefix=/your/preferred/path --enable-platform-XXX
  make
  make install

* From the tar archive:

  ./configure --prefix=/your/preferred/path --enable-platform-XXX
  make
  make install

WSim tools (tracer, console, ...) are located in the utils/ directory.
Each of the tools can be compiled and installed using autoconf scripts
(./configure && make)


Installation for Windows
------------------------
There are several ways to compile this software for windows:

1 Cygwin compile for Windows using Cygwin <http://www.cygwin.com/>
2 Windows native compile using the MinGW tools (doesn't provide networking)
3 Using the Mingw32 cross compiler from GNU/Linux (doesn't provide networking)



* Install the development framework, either native or the cross compiler one.

* Building Wsim 

    - 1/2, Cygwin and MinGW:
            ./configure 
	    make
            make install

    - Mingw32 cross compiler: 
            CC=i586-mingw32msvc-gcc CXX=i586-mingw32msvc-g++ \
            ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --build=i386-linux 

	    make
	    make install
