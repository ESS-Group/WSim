INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
======================

WSim dependencies and platform requirements are minimal.  Building the GUI
requires libSDL-1.2 and -dev installed.

You can choose to install WSim using either the GNU libbfd or the native
library included in WSim.


Linux/Unix
----------
* From the CVS archive: 

  # add -I/usr/local/share/aclocal to the next line if SDL is in /usr/local but
  # autotools aren't.
  autoreconf -i
  ./configure --prefix=/your/preferred/path --enable-platform-XXX
  make
  make install

* From the tar archive:

  ./configure --prefix=/your/preferred/path --enable-platform-XXX
  make
  make install

WSim tools (tracer, console, ...) are located in the utils/ directory.
Each of the tools can be compiled and installed using autoconf scripts
(./configure && make)


Installation for Windows
------------------------

There are several ways to compile this software for windows:

1 Cygwin compile for Windows using Cygwin <http://www.cygwin.com/>
2 Windows native compile using the MinGW tools (doesn't provide networking)
3 Using the Mingw32 cross compiler from GNU/Linux (doesn't provide networking)



* Install the development framework, either native or the cross compiler one.

* Building Wsim 

    - 1/2, Cygwin and MinGW:
            ./configure 
	    make
            make install

    - Mingw32 cross compiler: 
            CC=i586-mingw32msvc-gcc CXX=i586-mingw32msvc-g++ \
            ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --build=i386-linux 

	    make
	    make install


Solaris install
---------------

the solaris install using GNU libbfd needs the libiberty to compile wsim. This
library is available as part of the binutils distribution and must be compiled
and installed using the same options as the libbfd. 



MSPGCC cross compiling toolchain
================================

the GCC cross compiler for MSP430 is available at http://mspgcc.sf.net/
You need to checkout the complete CVS tree to build all the
necessary tools to compile msp430 binaries.

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/mspgcc login

hit [enter] when prompted for a password

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/mspgcc co -P . 

A building script is avalable in packaging/makefile
We are currently using binutils-2.16.1, gcc-core-3.2.3 and gdb-6.0 for
our development environment.

This script will install 
  binutils targeted for msp430
  msp430-gcc 
  msp430-libc
  msp430-gdb

msp430-insight is supported on some platforms (Linux, Solaris).
