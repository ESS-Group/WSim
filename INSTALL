WSim dependencies and platform requirements are minimal.
Building the GUI requires libSDL-1.2 installed.

You can choose to install WSim using le GNU libbfd or the native
library included in WSim.


Linux (Un*x)
------------
* From the CVS archive : 

  ./bootstrap
  ./configure --prefix=/your/preferred/path --enable-platform-XXX
  make
  make install

* From the tar archive :

  ./configure --prefix=/your/preferred/path --enable-platform-XXX
  make
  make install

WSim tools (tracer, console, ...) are located in the utils/ directory.
Eauch of the tools can be compiled and installed used autoconf scripts (./configure && make)


Installation for Windows
------------------------

There are two ways to compile this software for windows
* Native compile for Windows using the Cygwin tools suite (http://www.cygwin.com/).
* Using the Mingw32 Win32 cross compiler from GNU/Linux



* Install the development framework, either native or the cross compiler one.

* Building Wsim 

    - Cygwin :
            CC="gcc -mno-cygwin" CXX="g++ -mno-cygwin" \
            ./configure 

	    make
            make install

    - Mingw32 cross compiler : 
            CC=i586-mingw32msvc-gcc CXX=i586-mingw32msvc-g++ \
            ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --build=i386-linux 

	    make
	    make install


Solaris install
---------------

the solaris install using GNU libbfd needs the libiberty to compile wsim. This
library is available as part of the binutils distribution and 
must be compiled and installed using the same options as the libbfd. 



MSPGCC cross compiling toolchain
================================

the GCC cross compiler for MSP430 is available at http://mspgcc.sf.net/
You need to checkout the complete CVS tree to build all the
necessary tools to compile msp430 binaries.

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/mspgcc login

hit [enter] when prompted for a password

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/mspgcc co -P . 

A building script is avalable in packaging/makefile
We are currently using binutils-2.16.1, gcc-core-3.2.3 and gdb-6.0 for
our development environment.

This script will install 
  binutils targeted for msp430
  msp430-gcc 
  msp430-libc
  msp430-gdb

msp430-insight is supported on some platforms (Linux, Solaris)
