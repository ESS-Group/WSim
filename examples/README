This directory contains some small examples that can be run
using WSim platforms. They can be used to test basic functionnalities
but do not contain much msp430/AVR software or device drivers.

Please use these examples are small demo programs. Useful scripts usually
called demo.sh can be found in each directory.

The following examples are compatable with MSP430 Uniarch.
Other MSP430 examples are still to be used with mspgcc3 and mspgcc4.
