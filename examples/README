This directory contains some small examples that can be run
using WSim platforms. They can be used to test basic functionnalities
but do not contain much msp430/AVR software or device drivers.

Please use these examples are small demo programs. Useful scripts usually
called demo.sh can be found in each directory.

/examples/wsn430 are compatible with mspgcc uniarch. Other MSP430 examples
are still to be used with mspgcc3 and mspgcc4.
